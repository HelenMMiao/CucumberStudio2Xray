# CucumberStudio2Xray
Covert CucumberSutio test cases to Xray format

This script could be used if wanting to immigerate test cases from CucumberStudio to Xray.

Pre-Action: Export CucumberStudio cases manually and put it in project root folder.

Post-Action: Import test cases to Xray.

Data here is demo only. You will need to change logic according to your test case structure. The most import part is to format steps/results, which you could re-use in your project.
